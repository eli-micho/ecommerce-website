# eCommerce Website - Plant Planet

This project was created to develop a fullstack project with React, Redux and Firebase. The idea is to recreate the functionalities that a real eCommerce website would have.
The core functionalities are as follows:
-Users can create an account, either with email or login through Google.
-Users can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout (not real).
-Admin level users can manage products (i.e. add and remove products and product details).


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
